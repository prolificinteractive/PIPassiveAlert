A passive alert library in Objective-C. :rotating_light:

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+

## Installation

### CocoaPods
PIPassiveAlert is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "PIPassiveAlert", :git => 'git@github.com:prolificinteractive/PIPassiveAlert.git', :tag => '0.0.6'
```

### Carthage

You can also add PIPassiveAlert to your project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Add the following to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "prolificInteractive/PIPassiveAlert"
```

## Usage

### Configuration

#### Custom Nib

While a default look is provided for the alert, you have the option to provide a custom nib. The nib you provided *must* be of type `PIPassiveAlertView`.

For example, if we had a nib file with the file name `MyAlertView`, we could indicate a custom nib on our configuration as follows:

``` swift
config.nib = [UINib nibWithNibName:@"MyAlertView" bundle:nil];
```

Don't forget to implement `PIPassiveAlertView` delegate functions in your bustom nib, if desired!
